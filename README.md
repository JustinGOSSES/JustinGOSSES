hi :wave:, I'm Justin! 

I have professional interests across 📊 data visualization, 📝 natural language processing, 🗣️ speech-to-text, ⚒ geoscience, 📂 open data, 💻 open source, and 🏢inner source.

<!-- I currently work as a NASA :rocket: contractor wearing many hats :tophat: Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and Technical Program Manager.
 -->
Most of the repos on here are side projects. Geoscience is a dominant trend in these repos, because it is an area where I have a lot of domain knowledge. However, I don't use it in my day job, so it makes for a nice dividing line between work & side projects.

Currently, I’m working on updates to the side projects below that 🔭 fill a missing gap in working with a certain kind of scientific data on the web:
- [`wellio`](https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js) &mdash; library for converting well logs in LAS 2.0 format to JSON
- [`wellioviz`](https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellioviz) &mdash; library for visualizing well logs on the web

I'm also working on a template repository that can be pointed at any Awsome List via a config file and generate visualizations that help visualize the implicit 🕸️ community of developers in the Awesome List.

<!-- 🌱 After being on my "to-do" list for years, I have just started to learn <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/svg-rectangles">generative art</a> on <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>. And no, what you'll find at that link is not any good and that's okay. -->

💬 Ask me for side projects ideas. I have <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/sideproject_planning/blob/master/README.md">way too many</a> and love for things to suddenly exist that I think should exist.
