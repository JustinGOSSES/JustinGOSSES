hi :wave:, I'm Justin! 

I currently work as a NASA :rocket: contractor wearing many hats :tophat: Data Scientist, Software Engineer, and Technical Program Manager.

Most of the repos on here are side projects. Geoscience is a dominant trend in these repos, because it is an area where I have a lot of domain knowledge. However, I don't use it in my day job, so it makes for a nice dividing line between work & side projects.

ðŸ”­ Currently, Iâ€™m working on updates to the side projects below that fill a missing gap in working with a certain kind of scientific data on the web:
- [`wellio`](https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellio.js) &mdash; library for converting well logs in LAS 2.0 format to JSON
- [`wellioviz`](https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/wellioviz) &mdash; library for visualizing well logs on the web

ðŸŒ± After being on my "to-do" list for years, I have just started to learn <a href="https://observablehq.com/@justingosses/svg-rectangles">generative art</a> on <a href="https://observablehq.com/">Observable</a>. And no, what you'll find at that link is not any good and that's okay.

ðŸ’¬ Ask me for side projects ideas. I have <a href="https://github.com/JustinGOSSES/sideproject_planning/blob/master/README.md">way too many</a> and love for things to suddenly exist that I think should exist.
